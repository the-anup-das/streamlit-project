    The .streamlit folder, for now, is used to save the Streamlit configuration file including the theme.
    The app folder contains the main code in python that is the soul of your Streamlit app, what it displays, and how it reacts to user input.
    The assets folder is used to gather any images or other media that is useful for the app.
    The data folder, as the name suggests, will accommodate the data, that is, the brain of your Streamlit app.
    The requirements.txt file contains any packages that the app depends on.
